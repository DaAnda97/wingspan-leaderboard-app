Your buddy for the board game Wingspan


You love wingspan but hate summing up the points in the end? Here's your solution! Features like a leaderboard where you can campare the best results or an analytics overview will be added soon.
PLEASE NOTE: This app is a one persons project and developed in the spare time between lectures and job. It's published now in an early stage.
